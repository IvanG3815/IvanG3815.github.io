### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was a lab that I enjoyed because it challenged me when it came to understanding how to implement the conditions for the parking example. The first few parking times were easily able to be implemented with the (and) and (or) operators. The last parking time was more complicated. To implement it my group had to use both the (and) and (or) operators to create one big if statement that satisfied the conditions. This lab taught me how to properly use (and) and (or) operators.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was also interesting to me. It showed off a way of making the code more modular. The labâ€™s objective was to calculate the area of a rectangle of the dimensions that we input. In this lab we had to create a modular function that could read the arguments we put in. The rest of the lab was easy to complete.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was also enjoyable for me because it worked off one of the labs we had earlier on in the semester. This lab gave us the first view of random number generation. It also added in things that we had learned from past labs such as using stoi() and vectors. This lab was a satisfying upgrade from the first version of the guessing game and showed how one could upgrade it.
